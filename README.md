The website for this hospital management system was built using python-flask. Please read through the steps below to get the website working.

Requirements : 
1) Make sure you have python installed (python 3.8 or above recommended)
2) Have the virtual environment package pipenv installed
Command to install : pip install pipenv

Steps :
1) Create a virtual environment and activate it.
Command : py - m venv venv
To activate : venv\Scripts\activate

2) Use the Requirements file to install other necessary packages in the venv.
Command : pip install -r requirements.txt
In case a package does not get installed, try downloading its .whl file from 	websites like pypi.org, etc. and install it using pip install some-package.whl

3) Run the admin.py file using, python admin.py 
   If it throws an error you already have the default user created. 
Note : default username : admin,  password : admin
To create another user change the credentials inside the admin.py file and execute it.

4) Once all the above steps are done, execute the command : flask run.

Note : To run flask in development mode make sure FLASK_ENV=development is not commented in the .env file and vice versa.

The website was built and tested using Python 3.8.x and the packages as mentioned in the requirements.txt file. Any packages not installed may cause errors. The website was tested in Google chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge. There may be errors if using Internet explorer because it may not support the bootstrap version used.
